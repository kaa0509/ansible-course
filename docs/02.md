# YAML

YAML is important because we will use it for describing everything related to Ansible. YAML is a way of storing structured data as a text.

According [wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/YAML):

> YAML is a human-readable data-serialization language. It is commonly used for configuration files and in applications where data is being stored or transmitted. YAML targets many of the same communications applications as Extensible Markup Language (XML) but has a minimal syntax.

## YAML vs. JSON vs. XML

Conceptually, YAML is similar to JSON and XML. Let's take a look onto the same data structure but in different representation.

* **YAML**

```YAML
- name: provision
  hosts: localhost
  tasks:
   - yum:
     name:
      - httpd
      - git
     state: present
```

* **JSON**

```JSON
[
 {
  "name": "provision",
  "hosts": "localhost",
  "tasks": [
   {
    "yum": {
     "name": [
      "httpd",
      "git"
     ],
     "state": "present"
    }
   }
  ]
 }
]

```

* **XML**

```xml
<row-0>
 <name>provision</name>
 <hosts>localhost</hosts>
 <tasks>
  <yum>
   <name>httpd</name>
   <name>git</name>
   <state>present</state>
  </yum>
 </tasks>
</row-0>
```

As you can see they are pretty the same, but use completely different syntax to structurize the data. YAML uses an indentation format to define the structure. What should we know about YAML? There are some benefits:

* **No extra delimiter:** One of the most interesting YAML feature is that there is no extra delimiter.
* **Lightweight:** YAML is lighter than XML and JSON.
* **Simple & useful:** Not using delimiters also makes the reading light and simple. It makes the data understanding easily. So it is useful in case of describing configuration.

## YAML syntax

Let's talk about YAML syntax. YAML language accepts an Unicode character set. Custom data types are allowed, but YAML natively supported basic types such as strings, hashes and lists.

Document structure:

```YAML
---  # document start
# Comments in YAML look like this.
---
Yaml enables to have multiple docs.
---
In the same file
...  # document end
```

### Scalar types

Our root object (which continues for the entire document) is a *map*. *Map* is equivalent to a dictionary, hash or object in other languages. Maps are unordered groups of key-value pairs. Keys are separated from values by a colon and space.

```yaml
key: value
another_key: Another string value
a_number_value: 100
scientific_notation: 1e+12
# The number 1 will be interpreted as a number, not a boolean. if you want
# it to be interpreted as a boolean, use true
boolean: true
null_value: null
```

### Strings

Strings are one of the most popular data types. Notice that strings don't need to be quoted. However, they can be.

```yaml
string_value: asdasd
however: 'A string, enclosed in quotes.'
single quotes: 'have ''one'' escape pattern'
double quotes: "have many: \", \0, \t, \u263A, \x0d\x0a == \r\n, and more."
# UTF-8/16/32 characters need to be encoded
Superscript two: \u00B2
```

Multiple-line strings can be written either as a 'literal block' (using |) or a 'folded block' (using '>').

```YAML
literal_block: |
    This entire block of text will be the value of the 'literal_block' key,
    with line breaks being preserved.

    The literal continues until de-dented, and the leading indentation is
    stripped.

        Any lines that are 'more-indented' keep the rest of their
        indentation - these lines will be indented by 4 spaces.

folded_style: >
    This entire block of text will be the value of 'folded_style', but this
    time, all newlines will be replaced with a single space.

    Blank lines, like above, are converted to a newline character.

        'More-indented' lines keep their newlines, too -
        this text will appear over two lines.
```

|                    |  `>` | &#124; |      | `"`  | `'`  | `>-` | `>+` | `-`    | `+`    |
| -------------------|------|--------|------|------|------|------|------|--------|--------|
| Trailing spaces    | Kept | Kept   |      |      |      | Kept | Kept | Kept   | Kept   |
| Single newline =>  | `_`  | `\n`   | `_`  | `_`  | `_`  | `_`  | `_`  | `\n`   | `\n`   |
| Double newline =>  | `\n` | `\n\n` | `\n` | `\n` | `\n` | `\n` | `\n` | `\n\n` | `\n\n` |
| Final newline  =>  | `\n` | `\n`   |      |      |      |      | `\n` |        | `\n`   |
| Final dbl nl's =>  |      |        |      |      |      |      | Kept |        | Kept   |
| In-line newlines   | No   | No     | No   | `\n` | No   | No   | No   | No     | No     |
| Spaceless newlines | No   | No     | No   | `\`  | No   | No   | No   | No     | No     |
| Single quote       | `'`  | `'`    | `'`  | `'`  | `''` | `'`  | `'`  | `'`    | `'`    |
| Double quote       | `"`  | `"`    | `"`  | `\"` | `"`  | `"`  | `"`  | `"`    | `"`    |
| Backslash          | `\`  | `\`    | `\`  | `\\` | `\`  | `\`  | `\`  | `\`    | `\`    |
| `" #"`, `": "`     | Ok   | Ok     | No   | Ok   | Ok   | Ok   | Ok   | Ok     | Ok     |
| Can start on same  | No   | No     | Yes  | Yes  | Yes  | No   | No   | No     | No     |

### Collection types

As you remember, YAML uses an indentation format to define the structure. Nesting uses indentation. 2 space indent is preferred (but not required).

```YAML
a_nested_map:
  key: value
  another_key: Another Value
  another_nested_map:
    hello: hello
```

Sequences are equivalent to lists or arrays. They look like this.

```YAML
a_sequence:
  - Item 1
  - Item 2
  - 0.5  # sequences can contain disparate types.
  - Item 4
```


Please, note that the '-' counts as indentation.

### Long and short forms

Since YAML is a superset of JSON, you can also write JSON-style maps and sequences:

* *Maps*:

```YAML
# Single line form
Empl1: {name: Jack, job: Dev, skill: Elite}

# Multi-line form
Empl1:
    name: Jack
    job: Dev
    skill: Elite
```

* *Lists*

```YAML
#Single line form
fruits: [Apple, Orange, Mango]

# Multi-line form
fruits:
    - Apple
    - Orange
    - Strawberry
    - Mango
```

### Nested structures

```YAML
a_sequence:
  - key: value
    another_key: another_value
  -
    - This is a sequence
    - inside another sequence
  - - - Nested sequence indicators
      - can be collapsed
```

Lists and maps can be nested. Usually, we use Indentation to define nesting.

```YAML
# Single line form
Staff:
  - Empl1: {name: Jack, job: Dev}
  - Empl2: {name: John, job: QA}

# Multi-line form
Staff:
    - Empl1:
        name: Jack
        job: Dev
    - Empl2:
        name: John
        job: QA
```

### YAML is tricky

The examples bellow are rare, however, I have decided to show that YAML can be tricky.

#### Something interesting about keys

Keys can also be complex, like multi-line objects, can be float or empty.

```YAML
key with spaces: value
0.25: a float key
'Keys can be quoted too.': "Useful if you want to put a ':' in your key."
# We use ? followed by a space to indicate the start of a complex key.
? |
  keys can have
  multiple lines
: yes yes.
Didyouknow: another thing about keys
: empty keys are also a thing
```

#### Scalar types are not the picnic

Different YAML parsers can have different behaviour. You might want to type country names, but get *true* or *false*.

```YAML
Maybe_countries:
  - be
  - fr
  - nl
  - no
# Those mean true and false
[on, off, ON, OFF, yes, Yes, No, no, YES, NO]

```

Type conversation can cause some problems.

```YAML
# version numbers
Version_1: 1.3.0

# NOT a version
Version_2: 1.3
# that’s a float!
```

## Ansible

If you want to get high level overview about context appearance you can read about [CM & IaC](01.md). First of all let's define some terms.

### Playbooks

Usually, playbook is a file in YAML format. Also, Playbooks are Ansible language. Playbooks are the language by which Ansible orchestrates, configures, administers, or deploys systems. They are called playbooks partially because it’s a sports analogy, and it’s supposed to be fun using them. They aren’t workbooks :)

The playbook is just an YAML document. The document contains list of **plays**.

```YAML
- name: Play 1
  hosts: group_db
  roles:
    - role: postgress
- name: Play 2
  hosts: group_web
  roles:
    - role: apache
```

### Play

A play is minimally a mapping between a set of hosts selected by a host specifier (usually chosen by groups but sometimes by hostname globs) and the tasks which run on those hosts to define the role that those systems will perform. There can be one or many plays in a playbook.

```yaml
- name: The play name
  hosts: hostname_or_groupname
  pre_tasks:
    - name: Task
      debug:
        msg: Message
  roles:
    - role: rolename
```

### Tasks

Playbooks exist to run tasks. Tasks combine an action (a module and its arguments) with a name and optionally some other keywords (like looping directives). Tasks are executed in a sequence. In other words, Ansible executes one task at a time,  against all machines matched by the host pattern, before moving on to the next task.

Each **task** is part of sequence of sub-elements for keyword **tasks**.

```yaml
- hosts: localhost
  tasks:
    - name: Task 1
      debug:
        msg: Message 1
    - name: Task 2
      debug:
        msg: Message 2
```

### Modules

Modules are the units of work that Ansible ships out to remote machines. Modules can be implemented in any language, including Perl, Bash, or Ruby – but can leverage some useful communal library code if written in Python. Modules just have to return JSON. Once modules are executed on remote machines, they are removed, so no long running daemons are used.

### Glossary

There are a lot of terms out of scope and we can talk about them for ages. Thankfully, the [Ansible documentation](https://docs.ansible.com/) is absolutely fantastic. You can read the manual pages and quickly understand them.

* **Playbooks** are Ansible language.
* A **play** is a mapping between hosts & the tasks.
* **Tasks** combine a module, arguments with a name
* **Modules** are the units of work.
* **Roles** are bundle of related tasks.

### Example

Let's take a look onto simple playbook which can install the 2048 game at centos.

```YAML
---
- name: Install 2048
  hosts: all
  become: true
  become_user: root
  tasks:
    - name: Install software
      package:
        name:
          - httpd
          - git
        state: present
    - name: Checkout git repository
      git:
        repo: https://github.com/ultral/2048.git
        dest: /var/www/html
        force: true
        version: fc1ef4fe5a5fcccea7590f3e4c187c75980b353f
    - name: Allow access via HTTP
      iptables:
        chain: INPUT
        protocol: tcp
        destination_port: 80
        ctstate: NEW
        jump: ACCEPT
    - name: Start httpd
      systemd:
        name: httpd
        state: started
    - name: Print message
      debug:
        msg: "Play 2028: http://localhost:80/"
```
